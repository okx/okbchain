This repository hosts `OKBChain`, the implementation of the OKBChain based on the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.20](https://golang.org/dl/)


## Getting Started

Refer to the [document](https://www.okx.com/cn/okbc/docs/dev/quick-start/introduction/introduction-to-okbchain)

* [Install OKBC](https://www.okx.com/cn/okbc/docs/dev/quick-start/build-on-okbc/install-okbc)

OKB Chain (OKBC) is a Cosmos-based Ethereum sidechain that offers secured and user-friendly blockchain experience to all users. OKBC is a scaling solution that supports Cosmos,EVM and Wasm compatible smart contracts and protocols, and offersfast-finality from Tendermint Core BFT consensus.


* [Deploy your own OKBC Localnet](https://www.okx.com/cn/okbc/docs/dev/quick-start/build-on-okbc/deploy-your-own-okbc-localnet)

The documentation offers a guide on deploying your own OKBC localnet. By following this guide, you can set up a local network using OKBC, which allows you to experiment, develop, and test your blockchain applications in a controlled environment. The guide provides step-by-step instructions and details on how to deploy your own OKBC localnet, helping you get started with your development journey on OKBC.


* [Join the testnet](https://www.okx.com/cn/okbc/docs/dev/quick-start/build-on-okbc/join-public-testnet)

The documentation offers a quick-start guide on joining the OKBC public testnet. By following this guide, you can learn how to connect to the public testnet of OKBC, enabling you to interact with a live blockchain network and test your applications in a simulated production environment. The guide provides step-by-step instructions and relevant information to help you join the OKBC public testnet successfully and start building on the OKBC ecosystem.
The article offers guidance on joining the OKBC public testnet either using Docker or binaries.


* [Testnet faucet](https://www.okx.com/cn/okbc/faucet)

The OKBC Faucet is a service that allows users to obtain test tokens for the OKBC network. It is commonly used for testing purposes and acquiring tokens to experiment with OKBC's features and functionalities. By following the instructions on the OKBC Faucet page, users can request and receive test tokens to their designated OKBC wallet addresses. This resource is useful for developers and users who want to interact with OKBC in a test environment before engaging with the live network.


* [Latest snapshot](https://static.okex.org/cdn/okbc/snapshot/index.html) 

By accessing the snapshot page, users can download the latest snapshot file, which can be used to bootstrap or synchronize a new node more quickly. This is particularly helpful for new nodes joining the OKBC network or for recovering nodes from a backup.
